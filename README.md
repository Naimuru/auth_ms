# Authentication Microservice

This microservice is designed to handle authentication and user management for applications. It provides endpoints for registration, login, and user profile management.

## Architecture Overview

The microservice is built using Ruby on Rails, leveraging MVC architecture to ensure separation of concerns. It utilizes devise for secure authentication and communicates with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of user data.

### Components

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and respond with the appropriate HTTP responses.
- **Models**: Represent the data structure and contain business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for storing user credentials and profile information.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails and Docker.

## Getting Started

To get the microservice running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naimuru/auth_ms.git
   cd auth_ms

2. **Build the image**
This command builds the docker image.

   ```bash
   docker build -t auth_ms .

2. **Build the Docker Containers**
This command builds the Docker images and starts the containers, including the Rails application and the PostgreSQL database.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    
## Testing the Microservice

To test the functionality of the microservice, you can use Postman or any similar API testing tool.

- Register a New User
POST request - Endpoint: /api/v1/sign_up | with a JSON body containing the user's email and password.

   ```bash
   {
     "user": {
       "email": "test9@example.com",
       "password": "password123",
       "password_confirmation": "password123"
     }
   }

- Login
POST request - Endpoint: /api/v1/sign_in | with the user's credentials.

   ```bash
   {
     "user": {
       "email": "test9@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
   }
